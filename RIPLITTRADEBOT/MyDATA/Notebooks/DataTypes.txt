Types of Market Data Used in Quantitative Trading
Market data is essential for developing and executing quantitative trading strategies. Here's a detailed breakdown of the types of market data used:

Price Data

Historical Prices: Data on past prices of financial instruments (stocks, bonds, options, futures).
Tick Data: The most granular form of data, capturing every trade and quote.
Bar Data: Aggregated data over fixed intervals (e.g., 1-minute bars, daily bars) including open, high, low, and close prices (OHLC).
Volume Data

Trade Volume: Number of shares/contracts traded in a given period.
Order Book Volume: Volume of buy and sell orders at different price levels.
Order Book Data

Level 1 Data: Best bid and ask prices and their associated volumes.
Level 2 Data: Full depth of the order book, showing all buy and sell orders at different price levels.
Market Breadth Data

Advancers and Decliners: Number of stocks rising or falling in price.
Breadth Indicators: Indicators like the Advance/Decline line and McClellan Oscillator.
Tick-by-Tick Data

Trade Ticks: Details of individual trades including price, volume, and time.
Quote Ticks: Changes in bid and ask prices and sizes.
Corporate Actions Data

Dividends: Information on upcoming and historical dividend payments.
Stock Splits: Data on stock splits, reverse splits, and similar actions.
Earnings: Earnings announcement dates and results.
Economic Data

Macroeconomic Indicators: GDP, unemployment rates, inflation rates, interest rates.
Economic Releases: Scheduled releases of economic data that can impact markets.
Sentiment Data

News Sentiment: Sentiment analysis of news articles and social media.
Analyst Ratings: Changes in analyst ratings and price targets.
Alternative Data

Satellite Imagery: Data derived from satellite images (e.g., foot traffic to stores).
Web Scraping: Data collected from the internet (e.g., product reviews, social media trends).
Credit Card Data: Aggregated data on consumer spending patterns.
Options Data

Implied Volatility: Implied volatility from options prices.
Options Chains: Prices, volumes, and open interest for various strike prices and maturities.
TDP and UDP Data
1. TDP (Transaction Data Processor) Data

Definition: TDP data refers to detailed transactional information processed by exchanges or trading platforms. It captures the full breadth of trading activity, providing a comprehensive view of market transactions.

Components:

Trade Execution Data: Information on executed trades, including price, volume, time, and counterparty details.
Order Flow Data: Detailed records of order submissions, modifications, cancellations, and executions.
Market Depth Data: Comprehensive order book data, showing all buy and sell orders and their corresponding volumes.
Usage: TDP data is crucial for high-frequency trading (HFT) and for strategies that rely on understanding the microstructure of the market. It helps in analyzing order flow, market impact, and liquidity.

2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) Data

Definition: UDP is a communication protocol used for transmitting data over a network. In the context of financial markets, UDP data typically refers to market data feeds transmitted using the UDP protocol.

Characteristics:

Low Latency: UDP is preferred for market data feeds because it allows for faster data transmission compared to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
Unreliable Transmission: Unlike TCP, UDP does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction, making it less reliable but faster. This is acceptable for market data where the focus is on speed, and missing occasional packets can be tolerated.
Applications:

Market Data Feeds: Exchanges and data providers often use UDP to broadcast real-time market data, including price quotes, trade updates, and order book changes.
High-Frequency Trading: HFT firms use UDP data feeds to receive the latest market data with minimal latency, allowing them to execute trades quickly.
