Statistical Arbitrage:

Pairs Trading: Involves trading two correlated assets. When the prices diverge, traders sell the overvalued asset and buy the undervalued one, expecting them to converge again.
Index Arbitrage: Exploits price differences between an index and its constituent stocks.
Momentum Trading:

Trend Following: Buys assets that have shown upward price movement and sells assets that have shown downward movement.
Mean Reversion: Assumes that the price of an asset will revert to its mean or average price over time.
Market Making:

Provides liquidity by simultaneously placing buy and sell orders to capture the spread between bid and ask prices.
High-Frequency Trading (HFT):

Executes a large number of orders at extremely high speeds, capitalizing on minute price discrepancies.
Algorithmic Execution Strategies:

VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): Aims to execute an order close to the average price of the security throughout the day.
TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price): Spreads out the order over a specific time period to minimize market impact.
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Uses models trained on historical data to predict future price movements.
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models like linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Unsupervised Learning: Identifies patterns in data without predefined labels, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
Sentiment Analysis:

Analyzes news articles, social media, and other textual data to gauge market sentiment and make trading decisions based on the derived sentiment scores.
Arbitrage Strategies:

Triangular Arbitrage: Exploits price differences between three related currencies in the forex market.
Cross-Exchange Arbitrage: Identifies price differences for the same asset on different exchanges.
Option Pricing Models:

Uses models like Black-Scholes or binomial tree models to price options and identify mispriced options for trading.
Event-Driven Strategies:

Merger Arbitrage: Trades stocks of companies involved in mergers or acquisitions, buying the target company's stock and shorting the acquiring company's stock.
Earnings Announcements: Trades based on anticipated reactions to company earnings reports.
Factor Investing:

Identifies factors (e.g., value, growth, size, momentum) that explain asset returns and builds portfolios based on these factors.
Portfolio Optimization:

Uses mathematical models to construct a portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a given level of return.
